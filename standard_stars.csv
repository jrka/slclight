# Steward Observatory, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA
# January 1997; revised March 2001
# Abstract: Photometric standard stars chosen from Landolt (1992) are presented 
# in an atlas of 156 charts produced from Digital Sky Survey. Stars 
# are distributed throughout all hours of Right Ascension and most of 
# these UBVRI standards are equatorial. Charts are presented with a 
# 6.8' x 6.8' field of view.
