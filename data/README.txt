Instructions for the "data" folder in slclight

Each site/evening's observations will be collected in one folder, 
with the name lightdome_NAME, where "Name" is some identifying name.

Within each folder, you'll find the following:
- metadata.txt. Follow the template to record observing information.
- lights, a directory for the raw science images.
- calib, a directory for the calibration images (bias, darks, flats)
- final, a directory for the calibrated science images.
- results.txt, a file which summarizes the results, like the "photometric indicators"
  on the NPS Google Earth kml file. 
  
.fit files should not be included in the repo.
